## Introduction

This is my portfolio website when I was a student at Hanoi-Amsterdam high school for the Gifted. Link to my site: https://do-hoang-gia-huy-portfolio-website.netlify.app <br>
I use basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript with some external libraries such as Tween and ScrollMagic. <br>

My profile is updated with the lastest push. More about me on my Linkedin at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/do-hoang-gia-huy-bbb05921b/
